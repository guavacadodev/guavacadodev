👋 Hi, I’m Jake Woodall

Software Engineer • Founder

I’m a Seattle-based software engineer with 5+ years of experience building production-ready applications across iOS, web, and backend systems. I specialize in turning complex ideas into clean, scalable products—from early prototypes to launch-ready MVPs.
I’m the founder of iBite Technologies, where I design and build full-stack consumer products that blend mobile, AR, real-time systems, and modern backend architecture.

I am currently working on iBite. A next-generation food and rewards platform that combines:

- iOS (Swift / SwiftUI)
- Real-time data & Firebase
- Location-based experiences
- Gamified digital economies
- AR-driven restaurant discovery

📬 Open for Work

I’m open to:

- Full-time roles
- Contract / consulting work
- Startup collaborations
