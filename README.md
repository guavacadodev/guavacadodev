👋 Hi, I’m Jake Woodall

Software Engineer • Founder

I am from Seattle, WA. I like making iOS apps. But I can make anything ;)

I am currently working on iBite. A next-generation food and rewards platform that combines:

- iOS (Swift / SwiftUI)
- Real-time data & Firebase
- Location-based experiences
- Gamified digital economies
- AR-driven restaurant discovery

📬 Open for Work
